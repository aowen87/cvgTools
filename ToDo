Error handling:
    if at any point it is discovered that the file being read is not 
    sorted, than the program should alert the user and exit. 
    Also, if the file being read is not of the type specified, an error
    should be raised. 

Reading files:
    It may be much more efficient to process the data as the files
    are being read, rather than storing all of the data and then manipulating
    this data before writing. Instead, I could read the number of lines 
    neccessary, process them, write them, and then continue on until
    reaching the EOF. Write both version and test for speed?


Diff Input:
    make a method for diffing vairous input data; find the differences 
    between average values, and find where the values differ the most
    and by how much (how should this information be output? It would be 
    nice to build a histogram or other type of display from the data, but
    it might also be nice to have a wig file for view in IGV...).
