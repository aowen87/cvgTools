Foremost:
    * Test multiple file in/out
    * Define windows by baseline differences.
    * Integrate normalization into cvgTools.
    * Create a heap implemented priority queue to sort the data. 
    * Once the data can be sorted, make sure that input data is sorted. 
      If it isn't, sort the data. 

Soon:
    * Replace avl tree with hash map for compressing genic regions.
    * Create a max-heap implemented priority queue to sort the data. 
    * Once the data can be sorted, make sure that input data is sorted. 
      If it isn't, sort the data. 

Error handling:
    if at any point it is discovered that the file being read is not 
    sorted, the program should alert the user and exit. 
    Also, if the file being read is not of the type specified, an error
    should be raised. 

tools:
    -coverage computation. 
    -find correlations between data sets. 
    -more advanced window options
        *offsets
        *target specific areas of genes
