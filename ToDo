Foremost:
    * Test window wig writer
    * Create a max-heap implemented priority queue to sort the data. 
    * Once the data can be sorted, make sure that input data is sorted. 
      If it isn't, sort the data. 
    * Implement method for compressing genic regions (make sure there are
      no repeats, i.e. data must be sorted. 
    

Error handling:
    if at any point it is discovered that the file being read is not 
    sorted, than the program should alert the user and exit. 
    Also, if the file being read is not of the type specified, an error
    should be raised. 

Reading files:
    bed file input need more testing.

Normalize data:
    Wait to hear back from Vince. 

tools:
    -coverage computation. 
    -find correlations between data sets. 
    -merge gene sections (DO NEXT)
    -more advanced window options
        *offsets
        *target specific areas of genes
