## Introduction

**cvgTools** was created as a collaborative research project at the University of Oregon 
to help with DNA analysis being conducted in the department of molecular biology. The 
primary goals of this project are as follows:

 * 1. Provide some basic functionality, mainly in analyzing coverage 
      over genes and genic features. 
 * 2. Provide a modular framework that can easily be extended upon
      for future development. 

**Note for the user**

 * It should be noted that the primary developer of cvgTools is a computer scientist with
   only a basic background in molecular biology. Regardless of the support provided by 
   faculty in handling molecular data, this tool should be used with scrutiny and tested
   extensively.
